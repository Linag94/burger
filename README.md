# Good Burger Application

## Description

*Good Burger* is a burger logger with MySQL, Node.js, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!).

*Good Burger* application is a play off the movie Good Burger made in 1997. This application represents the main character Ed played by Kenan Thompson taking a customers order. The application is implemented using a [ORM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/orm), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/),[Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/installation.html), [Express](expressjs.com/) and [Jawsdb](https://www.jawsdb.com/) servers on the back end.

## Demo
	
*Good Burger* is deployed to Heroku. Please check it out [here](https://radiant-chamber-16651.herokuapp.com/index).

## Installation

To install the application follow the instructions below:

    -cd document/
	-git clone git@github.com:Linag94/burger.git/
	-cd burger/
	-npm install
	
## Running Locally

To run the application locally and access it in your browser, first set the `PORT` environment variable to the value of your choice. An example is shown below.

	export PORT=8080
	
After the `PORT` environment variable has been set, run the Node.js application with the command below.

	node server.js
	
The application will now be running locally on `PORT`, in this case that is port 8080. You can then access it locally from your browser at the URL `localhost:PORT`, in this case `localhost:8080`.**
